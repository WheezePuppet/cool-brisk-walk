\hline
\item At a swim meet, the competitors in the 100-m freestyle are Ben, Chad,
Grover, and Tim. These four swimmers make up our sample space $\Omega$ for
the winner of this heat. \\
Is Chad $\in \Omega$?
&
Yes.
\\
\hline
\item Is Tim an outcome?
&
Yes.
\\
\hline
\item Is Ben an event?
&
No, since outcomes are \textit{elements} of the sample space, while events
are \textit{subsets} of the sample space.
\\
\hline
\item Is \{~Chad, Grover~\} an event?
&
Yes.
\\
\hline
\item Is \{~Ben~\} an event?
&
Yes.
\\
\hline
\item Suppose I told you that Pr(\{Ben\})=.1, Pr(\{Chad\})=.2, Pr(\{Grover\})=.3,
and Pr(\{Tim\})=.3. Would you believe me?
&
Better not. This is not a valid probability measure, since the sum of the
probabilities of all the outcomes, Pr($\Omega$), is not equal to 1. 
\\
\hline
\item Suppose I told you that Pr(\{Ben, Chad\})=.3, and Pr(\{Ben, Tim\})=.4, and
Pr(\{Grover\})=.4. Could you tell me the probability that Ben wins the
heat?
&
Yes. If Pr(\{Ben, Chad\})=.3 and Pr(\{Grover\})=.4, that leaves .3
probability left over for Tim. And if Pr(\{Ben, Tim\})=.4, this implies
that Pr(\{Ben\})=.1.
\\
\hline
\item And what's the probability that someone besides Chad wins?
&
Pr($\overline{\{\text{Chad}\}}$) = $1 - $Pr(\{Chad\}), so we just need to
figure out the probability that Chad wins, and take one minus that. Clearly
if Pr(\{Ben, Chad\})=.3 (as we were told), and Pr(\{Ben\})=.1 (as we
computed), then Pr(\{Chad\})=.2, and the probability of a non-Chad winner
is .8.
\\
\hline
\item Okay, so we have the probabilities of our four swimmers Ben, Chad,
Grover, and Tim each winning the heat at .1, .2, .4, and .3, respectively.\\
Now suppose Ben, Chad, and Grover are UMW athletes, Tim is from Marymount,
Ben and Tim are juniors, and Chad and Grover are sophomores. We'll
define $U$=\{Ben,Chad,Grover\}, $M$=\{Tim\}, $J$=\{Ben,Tim\}, and
$S$=\{Chad,Grover\}. \\
What's Pr($U$)?
&
.7.
